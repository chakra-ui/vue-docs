# Getting Started with Chakra UI Vue

> Please note that our docs are still under development. 

Awesome that you would like to get started with **Chakra UI Vue** ðŸ¥³.

Let's see how we can do this! We will start from a [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) project. Don't worry, this can be a new or existing project.
If you are looking to install `Chakra UI Vue` in an other Vue meta-framework take a look [here](../2.frameworks/0.index.md).

The first thing we need to do is install the `Chakra UI Vue` package and its dependencies in the Vue project.
This can be achieved with the following terminal command:

```bash
pnpm install @chakra-ui/vue-next
```

Or if you prefer using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @chakra-ui/vue-next
```

## Usage

Perfect, now before we can use the features of Chakra UI, we will have to add it to the Vue.js instance.
For this, we have to import the `ChakraUIVuePlugin` from the `Chakra UI Vue` package in the `main.ts` file.
And tell the application that we want to use the plugin. This will make Chakra UI Vue components available to use in your Vue app.

```tsx
// main.ts
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import ChakraUIVuePlugin from '@chakra-ui/vue-next'


const app = createApp(App).use(ChakraUIVuePlugin)
app.mount('#app')
```

This will also be the place were we can add extra `options` to the Chakra UI Vue plugin to extend Chakra's features for the application. 
But let's not dive into that yet, let's first see how we can use Chakra UI Components. An overview of all the components can be found here.

## Using Chakra Components

Once you've installed and imported Chakra UI Vue, you can start using its components in your app. 
Let's pick the `Button` component, which is called `CButton` from the package. 
(Note that we are using the [script setup](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html) here)

```tsx
// App.vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { CButton } from "@chakra-ui/vue-next"
</script>
```

Next, we want to display the button on the page. After we imported it, the button will be available in the template.

```tsx
// App.vue
<template>
  <CButton color-scheme="green">Button</CButton>
</template>
```

There we go! ðŸš€ 

We have a working button with some styling. Thanks to styled props, we can style `Chakra UI Vue` components.
Like we did here with our button, making it use the `green` color scheme. 
Let's learn about styled props and the theming API of Chakra UI Vue here.
